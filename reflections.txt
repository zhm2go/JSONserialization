1.
When it comes to nesting or recursive calls,
I need much time to clear my mind
and get its logic to complete it,
such as serialization and deserialization.
However, some simple tasks which take me witinin
an hour are estimated as 2 or more hours.
It seems I need a better insight of planning and
time managing, as well as correctly
check my ability to do a certain task.
Large projects for me is hard to divide into
reasonable pieces, and try to complete them
separately. So sometimes I find another
problem when doing a huge task.

2.
Well, I did very bad in meeting the ddls.
The first ddl I met was two days after as it
had been, and then I often spent 10 or more hours
to do this assignment one day and did nothing in
the next day. The last few days I almost took
every minute to proceed it.

3.
converting it into C++ should be easier, the if/else
and for/while loop are quite the same. For python,
I can tell it needs longer time to modify, but its
format is simple too.

To accept XML files, I suppose to have a format
transformer, to convert them independently.
Otherwise it needs almost rewriting the code.

I know little about XML, but a converter for
output seems more attractive. 

4.
If I know more about JSONObject and JSONArray,
plus methods to them and other types, I
should be more skilled to do this.

Open/close principle works in this assignment,
as I need more small functions to construct
larger ones, rather than make everything in
a long code.

5.

Plan and start at the very begining, especially
when it is posted. requiring an extension is
also ok if reasonable. At last,
start early, earlier, or as earliest as possible.
